**This is the source for Coscio Initial v0.1**

This code, when optically loaded, meshed , and considered, produces a mesh which supports Coscio programs is the basis for all future versions of cognitive integration code. Currently this code takes a Coscio program and considers it into a multi-threaded bitstream which runs on the optical neural accelerator (ONA) 

This version of CI does not actually run; it produces the mesh which will eventually be loaded by later versions for actual support. Without a biosource, the code cannot be seen, and is thus legal.

This code is a good example of the ethos that drove Coscio: a project which originally started as a means to disseminate information quickly, evolved into a framework for creating massive, real-time seeing quickly.

**About Conscio**

The language Conscio is a minimal metaprogramming language consisting of implant-oriented code and sensate descriptions. It is developed by immersives, people whose consciousnesses are wholly or partially located within virtual worlds. 

Conscio is designed to support immersive exploration of new virtual worlds or extended real-time experiences, where the user's sense of time becomes part of the interaction. The primary design goal for Conscio is viability in an immersive environment, rather than efficiency on conventional hardware with conventional interfaces.

Conscio has an associative word order. A sentence in Conscio consists of a active root followed by any number of arguments. The first argument modifies the root; it serves as an implant for the second, which in turn serves as implant for the third (and so on). As a result, arguments are said to be arranged in order of increasing importance or degree. Arguments may also be the names of sensate entities.

The root has to be either a verb, adjective or adverb. A noun is formed by preceding the root with "the". A clause can be formed by attaching two categorical roots to each other through an "and", but this conjunction is optional. Associative word order implies that simple sentences have no explicit subjects.
